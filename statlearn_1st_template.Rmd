Research Title
----------
*Provide a title for your research project.*

----------


Abstract
----------
*Short overview of the project.*

----------


Main research aim \& framework
----------
*Describe the main goal(s) of your project, why you are interested in it, 
and how you came up with this idea. If there are also secondary goals, list them too.*

*Please cite any paper, webpage, video, other kind of support material that 
help in understading the feasibility and relevance of your work.
List all the references in the last Section of this document.*

----------

IML paper(s) you like (at this point!)
----------

*List here the papers on interpretable/explainable ML and related fields that you'd like to integrate in your work. Also please spend few words to tell me why you like them.*

-------

Data source(s) 
----------
*Differently from previous years, the [Science Journal App](https://sciencejournal.withgoogle.com/experiments/) (now called [Arduino Science Journal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arduino-science-journal/id1518014927), see also [here](https://science-journal.arduino.cc/)) is not mandatory for this project.*
*Hence, please describe the software/hardware/tools/platforms/apps/devices/etc you are planning to use in order to get the data you need.*

----------

Data collection
----------
*Explain how you are plannig to actually collect the data.*
*How many data-points do you (realistically) hope to collect?*
*Do you foresee any difficulty in the data collection process?*
*Approximatively, how "heavy" do you think your dataset will be in the end?*

----------

Model \& Methods
----------
*To the best of your current knowledge, what type of statistical/data analysis tools do you feel will be relevant?*
*Explain briefly why.*

*If there's some cutting edge methods you may like to implement, cite it here adding the relevant paper(s)/book(s) in the last Section of this document.*

*In particular, how the IML analysis described in the papers you selected fits into your project*

----------


Software/Hardware Toolkit
----------
*Tell me something about the software, programming language(s), package(s), module(s), framework(s) you're planning to use to handle/model/analyse your data and why.*
*Are you also planning to use or develop dedicated hardware for this task?*
*If you feel your home-computer/laptop may not be enough to handle everything, explain to me why and what kind of resources you may instead need.*

----------

Project Timeline
----------
*Assuming I like and approve your proposal, detail how you are planning to organize your work in terms of sub-tasks completion.
If you know what a [Gantt diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) is, [use it](https://plot.ly/r/gantt/)!*

----------


References
----------
*List here all the reference cited above. If you know what it is, it will be very much appreciated if you use and then upload on Moodle a [.bib file](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#bibliographies).*
