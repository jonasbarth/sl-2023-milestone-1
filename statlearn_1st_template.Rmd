Research Title
----------
*Provide a title for your research project.*

----------


Abstract
----------
*Short overview of the project.*

----------


Main research aim \& framework
----------
*Describe the main goal(s) of your project, why you are interested in it, 
and how you came up with this idea. If there are also secondary goals, list them too.*

*Please cite any paper, webpage, video, other kind of support material that 
help in understading the feasibility and relevance of your work.
List all the references in the last Section of this document.*

The main goal of this project is to predict the amount of **accumulated delay** on a public transport route operated by ATAC in the city of Rome. 

Public transport in Rome is notoriously underdeveloped and faces many problems from procurement corruption [@de_santis_2022] to spontaneously combusting buses [@agi_2021] and Russian hacker attacks [@russian_hacker_roma_today_2023]. Still, hundreds of thousands of Romans rely on ATAC and its busses, trams, and metros to get them to their destinations, every day. On those journeys, delays are another major problem that ATAC riders have to deal with on a daily basis. Delays reduce the ability to plan ones day and are cause for much nuisance. For that reason, knowing how much delay to expect on a specific route would be beneficial for the user of ATAC services, as it would enable them to at adjust their schedules or choose alternative transport means.

Public transport delay forecasting is a challenge that has enjoyed some attention [@heppe_liebig_2017; @rodriguez_villani_2022; @yap_cats_2020; @fabrikant_2019; @peters_emig_jung_schmidt_2005] and remains a relevant problem, especially as public transport systems have been identified as a main sector of action to reach the objectives of the European Green Deal [@ec_sustainable_travel_2021] and are bound to receive more attention and investment.

----------

IML paper(s) you like (at this point!)
----------

*List here the papers on interpretable/explainable ML and related fields that you'd like to integrate in your work. Also please spend few words to tell me why you like them.*

-------

Data source(s) 
----------
*Differently from previous years, the [Science Journal App](https://sciencejournal.withgoogle.com/experiments/) (now called [Arduino Science Journal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arduino-science-journal/id1518014927), see also [here](https://science-journal.arduino.cc/)) is not mandatory for this project.*
*Hence, please describe the software/hardware/tools/platforms/apps/devices/etc you are planning to use in order to get the data you need.*

----------

Data collection
----------
*Explain how you are plannig to actually collect the data.*
*How many data-points do you (realistically) hope to collect?*
*Do you foresee any difficulty in the data collection process?*
*Approximatively, how "heavy" do you think your dataset will be in the end?*

----------

Model \& Methods
----------
*To the best of your current knowledge, what type of statistical/data analysis tools do you feel will be relevant?*
*Explain briefly why.*

*If there's some cutting edge methods you may like to implement, cite it here adding the relevant paper(s)/book(s) in the last Section of this document.*

*In particular, how the IML analysis described in the papers you selected fits into your project*

----------


Software/Hardware Toolkit
----------
*Tell me something about the software, programming language(s), package(s), module(s), framework(s) you're planning to use to handle/model/analyse your data and why.*
*Are you also planning to use or develop dedicated hardware for this task?*
*If you feel your home-computer/laptop may not be enough to handle everything, explain to me why and what kind of resources you may instead need.*

----------

Project Timeline
----------
*Assuming I like and approve your proposal, detail how you are planning to organize your work in terms of sub-tasks completion.
If you know what a [Gantt diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) is, [use it](https://plot.ly/r/gantt/)!*
